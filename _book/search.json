Here’s what I think about this book.\n\nThis book is specifically about using R for research in medical and clinical fields. Therefore, the examples in this book will be mostly if not all from the medical field.\nThis book is straight to the point and very specific without too much going into the nitty gritty of the technicality.\nThis book focuses on data analysis and report generation. As such, this book is particularly suitable for researchers in all fields, particularly in medical field.\nTools used in this book are the most modern and up to date. The old-style programming (base R style of coding has a steep learning curve whereas the new tidyverse suite of libraries have made this much easier and provides flexible framework for quick data analysis and producing publication quality graphics and tables."

Even better, you would think, why not just use ChatGPT?\nI must say, if you want to learn and be fluent in Python, do not copy codes, do not use ChatGPT (except to inqure why you code shows error).\n\nThe biggest benefit of wiring code is reproducibility.\n\n\nEven if you make a mistake, the mistake should be reproducible\n\n\nBy writing codes, you can easily try different things as data analysis involves a lot of trial and error and explorations."
