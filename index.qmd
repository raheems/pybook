##  Why this book? {.unnumbered}

This book serves as a companion to Statistics for Data Science with Python. Yes, you read it right. I wanted to teach a Statistics course with Python. However, many students, including most statisticians do not use Python in their day to day job. Therefore, there is a void to fill. A book just to learn Python for Data Science. By data science I mean all things related to data--data analysis, data wrangling, data science, experimenting with data, causal inference, and of course, machine learning and deep learning.

I have been programming with R for over 23 years now. That's a long time to understand a language and feel comfortable using it. I do. In contrast, my experience with Python is little over 7 years now (2023). I can certainly feel that I do not understand Python as I understand R. This is because the time I spent with R and solved numerious kinds of problems with it is much more diverse and broad than my experience with Python and some of its commonly used libraries. 

s written by someone who is not a trained computer scientist. However, with over 20 years analytic experience, and going through the journey myself and teaching hundreds of students, like every teacher, I feel I have something to give back. 

The goals of this book is the following:

- a self-learner's guide to data science with Python
- sequentially organized--you have to start from the beginning and gradually grow with it
- 

## Work in progress

I am actively writing this book. This is by no means a complete book. And it will never likely be complete as it will be actively developed, tested, re-written and deployed!

Thank you for your interest and thanks a bunch for your patience! 

Since the book is actively being updated, that means, the organization of the contents is not finalized. As such, bookmarks would not be stable at this point. I would advise not to bookmark any chapter or section. Instead, bookmark the website of the book which is [https://pybook.eraheem.com](https://pybook.eraheem.com).
